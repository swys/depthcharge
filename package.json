  "description": "depthcharge is a function that will take in a root directory and a
  subdirectory as arguments and output an integer depth. The depth represents how
  deeply nested the subdirectory is as compared to the root directory.

  For example if `tmp/` is the root and `tmp/hello` is the subdirectory then the returned value would be `1`.
  If there is an error it will return -1."
